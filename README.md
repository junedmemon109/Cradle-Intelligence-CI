# Cradle Intelligence (CI)

**Problem Statement:**

Balancing the demands of modern life and providing proper care for newborns is a major challenge for parents, as newborns have unpredictable needs and the fast-paced lifestyle of modern society leaves little time for constant supervision. This lack of proper care and monitoring puts infants at risk of death due to neglect.


**Proposed Solution:**

Developing a Smart Cradle System using IoT technology, equipped with a webcam, temperature & humidity sensors, and automatic swinging capabilities to provide parents with real-time monitoring.


**Uniqueness of the Proposed Solution:**

The uniqueness of the proposed Smart Cradle System lies in its integration of IoT technology, equipped with a webcam, temperature & humidity sensors, and automatic swinging capabilities, which provides a comprehensive and convenient solution for parents to monitor and ensure the proper care for their newborns.
