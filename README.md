# Cradle Intelligence (CI)

**Problem Statement:**

Balancing the demands of modern life and providing proper care for newborns is a major challenge for parents, as newborns have unpredictable needs and the fast-paced lifestyle of modern society leaves little time for constant supervision. This lack of proper care and monitoring puts infants at risk of death due to neglect.


**Proposed Solution:**

Developing a Smart Cradle System using IoT technology, equipped with a webcam, temperature & humidity sensors, and automatic swinging capabilities to provide parents with real-time monitoring.


**Uniqueness of the Proposed Solution:**

The uniqueness of the proposed Smart Cradle System lies in its integration of IoT technology, equipped with a webcam, temperature & humidity sensors, and automatic swinging capabilities, which provides a comprehensive and convenient solution for parents to monitor and ensure the proper care for their newborns.


**Hardware Requirements:**
1. Raspberry Pi 4
2. GrovePi
3. Grove DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
4. Grove Sound Sensor
5. USB Camera
6. Servo SG90 Motor
7. Grove connectors (2)
8. Jumper Wires (3 Male to Female Cable)

**Software Requirements:**
1. Fing (Network scanner)
2. PuTTY
3. VNC Viewer 
4. Raspbian OS
5. Thony Python IDE
